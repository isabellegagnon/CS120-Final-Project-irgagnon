# CS120 Final Project

* This program is loosely based on an old mini game I used to play.  It is used to test mouse accuracy skills.  
* The user will press the spacebar to begin the game and the shaped will appear.  The instructions will say which shape to press to gain a point.  If the user accurately presses the specified shape, they will earn a point.  If the wrong shape is pressed, a point will be dedcuted.  The user has one minute to accurately press the shape as many times as they can.  
* The modules these concepts came from were module 4 (graphics, mouse input) and module 2 (Has-A and Is-A class relationships).  
* Sources used are cited in the classes of the program.
